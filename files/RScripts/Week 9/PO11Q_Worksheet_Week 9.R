# The mean mark of GPS (105.76) is higher than reading (103.56) and maths (104.70).
# This indicates that on average students performed better in GPS than reading or maths.
# The standard deviation of reading (5.42) is higher than maths (5.10) and GPS (4.61).
# This indicates that marks are more spread out from the mean for reading than
# they are for maths and GPS.

# P < 0.05; CI does not contain 100; 2 < t (2 t rule of thumb for 95% confidence level).
# For all three tests, the means are statistically different from 100.

t.test(ks2$avg_all, alternative = "less", mu = 105, conf.level = 0.99)
# Mean is statistically less than 100 at 99% confidence level.

ks2$english <- with(ks2, (reading + gps) / 2)

# 5.B
t.test(ks2$english, alternative = "less", mu = 105, conf.level = 0.999)
# Mean is statistically less than 105.

# 5.C
t.test(ks2$english, alternative = "two.sided", mu = 105, conf.level = 0.999)
# Mean is not statistically different from 105.

# 5.D
# The first t test is statistically significant but the second one is not,
# despite having the same mu value and the same values in the variable.
# The second t test loses its statistical significance due to being a
# two-sided t test whilst the first t test is a one-sided t test. This means
# that the first test has a statistically significant tail consisting of
# 0.001 of the total area under the normal probability distribution,
# whilst the second test has two statistically significant tails consisting
# a total of 0.001 of the total area under the distribution, or 0.0005 under
# the distribution for each individual tail. Because of this, the confidence
# interval of the two-sided t test is wider whilst the one for the one-sided
# t test is smaller, meaning it is harder for the two-sided t test to
# be statistically significant, showing why it is not significant when
# the one-sided t test is significant. This is illustrated in the below
# one-sided t test, which has a confidence level of 99.95%:
t.test(ks2$english, alternative = "less", mu = 105, conf.level = 0.9995)
# Note the statistical insignificance and the same confidence interval
# as the two-sided t test.

# 6.C
t.test(ks2$english[ks2$maths_pass == "Fail"], alternative = "less", mu = 100, conf.level = 0.95)
# Statistically significant, indicating that students who fail maths achieve

# 7.b
t.test(ks2$avg_all[ks2$pass_fail == "Fail"], alternative = "less", mu = 100, conf.level = 0.95)
# Statistically significant, indicating that students who fail one or more test
# have an overall average mark less than 100, on average. This is expected. However,
# the practical significance is worth drawing attention to; the mean of this group
# is 98.88% and the upper CI is 99.23%, indicating that the mean mark of this
# group is only just below the pass mark, suggesting that whilst the difference
# is statistically significant, there is not much practical significance as
# students who fail only seem to fail relatively narrowly on average.

# 8.a
ks2$normal <- with(ks2, ((avg_all - 80) / (120 - 80)) * 100)
# This scale is useful since it is now percentage based, with 0 representing
# a 0% score (excluding ungraded marks), 50 representing a 50% score,
# and 100 representing a 100% score. This makes it more easy to interpret than
# the previous 80-120 scale.
